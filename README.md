# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

Bitcoin, due to its popularity, has caught a price jump making it unaffordable for many new investors. The good news, however, is that there are many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices.  A prominent investment bank called Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. I have gotten the opportunity to pitch an investment in Cryptocurrency to Accountability Accounting. They have asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

Data sets of cryptocurrencies are available to be analyzed in any way I want. However, the data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I am looking for, I will use unsupervised machine learning to discover trends that will convince the firm to invest in these new cryptocurrencies. To group the cryptocurrencies, I will use a clustering algorithm then use data visualizations to share my findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.
