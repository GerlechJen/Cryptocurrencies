# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

Bitcoin, due to its popularity, has caught a price jump making it unaffordable for many new investors. The good news, however, is that there are many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices.  A prominent investment bank called Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. I have gotten the opportunity to pitch an investment in Cryptocurrency to Accountability Accounting. They have asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

Data set of cryptocurrencies is available as a CSV file to be analyzed in any way I want. However, the data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I am looking for, I will use unsupervised machine learning to discover trends that will convince the firm to invest in these new cryptocurrencies. To group the cryptocurrencies, I will use a clustering algorithm then use data visualizations to share my findings with the board of Accountability Accounting.

## Results
To begin with, I preprocessed the data. I read it to a Pandas DataFrame. The original dataframe had 1252 rows and 6 columns. I kept all the cryptocurrencies that are being traded and have a working algorithm which reduced the rows to 1144. I then dropped teh IsTrading column and removed rows that have at least one null value. The data frame now had 685 rows and 5 columns. The DataFrame was filtered so it only had rows where coins are mined and this reduced the rows to 532.
rom this dataframe I created a new dataframe that held only the cryptocurrency names, and used the crypto_df DataFrame index as the index for this new DataFrame. Afterwards I removed the CoinName column from the crypto DataFrame since it was not going to be used on the clustering algorithm. The dataframe obtained is shown below:

Using  the get_dummies() method I created variables for the two text features, Algorithm and ProofType, and stored the resulting data in a new DataFrame named X. This dataframe had 532 rows and 98 columns. Then use the StandardScaler fit_transform() function I standardized the features from the X DataFrame which completed the preprocessing of my data.

Continuing with my tasks, I reduced the data dimensions using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. I reduced the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and placed these dimensions in a new DataFrame. This DataFrame named pcs_df included the following columns: PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3, and used the index of the crypto_df DataFrame as the index. The code used to obtain this datafrae is shown below:

``` python 
# Using PCA to reduce dimension to three principal components.
pca = PCA(n_components=3)
crypto_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
# Create a DataFrame with the three principal components.
pcs_df = pd.DataFrame(data = crypto_pca, columns = ["PC 1", "PC 2", "PC 3"], index = crypto_df.index)
```

The pcs_df is also as shown:

It was then time to cluster the Cryptocurrencies Using K-means algorithm.  Using the pcs_df DataFrame, I created an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K.

The best value was seen to be 4. Then, I run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data.


Finally I made Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
